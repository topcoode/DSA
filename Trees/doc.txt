> A struct that represents a node in the binary tree. 
> Each node should have an integer value and pointers to its left and right child nodes.


> Inserting Nodes: When inserting a node into a binary tree, ensure that all nodes to the left have smaller values, 
> while all nodes to the right have larger values. 
> Implement an insert function that adds nodes accordingly


> Tree Traversal: There are three main types of tree traversals - preorder, inorder, and postorder. 
> These traversals involve visiting nodes in a specific order. 
> Implement functions for each type of traversal to navigate through the binary tree
